# Sectalks 2016 Web CTF

This repository contains all the docker-compose files and source code for the web CTF I created for SecTalks Brisbane back in 2016.

[@justinsteven](https://twitter.com/justinsteven) has done a really awesome 3 part YouTube series solving each of these challenges. If you need a push in the right direction, I highly recommend you check them out [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCBmFvsR6sIPrmjSVVxY9ng/videos).


# Getting started

1. Pull down the repository: `git@github.com:scarvell/sectalks-2016-web-ctf-docker.git`
2. `cd` into the challenge directory containing the `docker-compose.yml` file
3. Run `docker-compose up`

Please be paitent as each challenge downloads and starts up.

# FAQ

> Can I use your CTF challenges else where?

Probably not. But do feel free to reach out to discuss what you want to use it for.

> Can I stream or produce a write up for these?

Of course! Please ping me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/menztrual) if you do. Id love to see how you went about solving it.

> What about "The Illusionist"?

It'll come. I just want to make sure I have no future plans for it before releasing it.
